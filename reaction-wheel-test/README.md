## Filtered Angle

The fitlered angle, that uses a combination of the gyro and the `SH2_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR` seems to be pointless. I think the `SH2_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR` already does some filtration in the box and it just responds better and faster to all the changes and seems more accurate than the filtered angle I created based on the python example.
